# QtGraphsProjects

This repository contains various projects built using the **Qt** framework that involve working with **graphs**. These projects demonstrate different algorithms, data structures, and visualizations of graph theory concepts using the powerful graphical user interface (GUI) tools provided by Qt.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Graph Visualization**
- **Description**: Visualizes basic graphs and algorithms in a GUI. This project can be used for educational purposes to illustrate graph structures and their properties.
- **Key Features**:
  - Visual representation of nodes and edges.
  - Supports different types of graph algorithms for pathfinding, connectivity, and traversal.
  - Dynamic interaction, where nodes and edges can be clicked to select or delete.

### 2. **Graph Algorithms**
- **Description**: Contains implementations of various graph algorithms such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Kruskal’s Algorithm**, and **Prim’s Algorithm**. The focus is on teaching graph traversal, spanning tree generation, and the workings of minimum spanning tree algorithms.
- **Key Features**:
  - Algorithms are implemented and visualized step-by-step.
  - Interactive mode where users can provide custom input (graphs, start nodes, etc.).
  - Suitable for learning and visualizing fundamental graph algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Qt Framework (Qt5/Qt6)**
- **Graph Theory Algorithms** (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, Kruskal, Prim)
- **QGraphicsView** for interactive visualization
- **XML** for graph data storage (Luxembourg map data)
